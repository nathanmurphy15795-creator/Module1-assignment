        <h1>Album Reviews</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my review site for Fontaines D.C. albums!</p>

       <h2> Introduction</h2>
       <p>
        Fontaines D.C. continue to redefine modern post-punk with a sound that manages to feel both jagged and poetic. This site explores their discography in review form- focusing on how each album builds on the bands evolution from Dublin grit to atmospheric introspection. </p>
       </p>

       <h3>Featured: "A Hero's Death" - A Shift in Tone</h3>
    <p>
        Making a turning point in their sound, <em>A Hero's Death</em> trades some of the raw energy of their debut for a more contemplative and layered approach. The album delves into themes of existential angst and disillusionment, with tracks like "I Don't Belong" and the title track showcasing a band unafraid to explore vulnerability. The production is more polished, allowing the lyrical depth to shine through while still retaining the band's signature intensity.
