<tr>
<td>Dogrel</td>
<td>2019</td>
<td>A raw and electrifying debut that bottles the pulse of Dublin’s post-punk underground. Dogrel is driven by sharp, propulsive rhythms and unapologetically local lyricism, pairing street-level storytelling with poetic swagger. It’s an album that feels both traditional and rebellious, drawing on punk roots while giving them a literary twist. The band’s chemistry is immediate and urgent, marking the record as one of the most confident debuts of the decade.</td>

<tr>
<td>A Hero's Death</td>
<td>2020</td>
<td>A deliberate step inward, this moodier and more hypnotic follow-up trades debut-album ferocity for introspection. Slower tempos, brooding textures, and existential themes create a record steeped in disillusionment, self-interrogation, and artistic expansion. The repetition and mantra-like songwriting reinforce its themes of searching and uncertainty. It ultimately shows a band refusing the path of easy success, choosing instead to challenge their audience and themselves.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>Skinty Fia</td>
<td>2022</td>
<td>Dark, atmospheric, and thematically rich, Skinty Fia deepens the band’s exploration of identity, displacement, and cultural memory. Haunting arrangements and shadowy tones meet some of their most nuanced songwriting, resulting in what many consider their most mature and ambitious work. The blend of personal narrative with broader cultural reflection gives the album a rare emotional weight. Its production is also more refined, creating a fully immersive mood that lingers long after listening.</td>
</tr>

<tr>
    <td>Romance</td>
    <td>2024</td>
    <td>Tender, reflective, and sonically expansive, Romance shifts toward vulnerability and emotional openness. Poetic lyricism blends with lush soundscapes to create an album centered on love, loss, and the complexities of human connection. The record moves with a dreamier, more cinematic feel than their earlier work. It shows a band comfortable with evolution, embracing softness without losing the intensity that defines them.</td>
